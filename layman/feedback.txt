Joel:

Hi,
 
Thank you for sending it.
 
When I read it, it seems to be on two legs: First you introduce the project through sleep apnea and work it out from the application 
side. Then you say: well, there are a lot of other pathologies where a similar approach would work, hence we want to develop a technique 
that works generically; thus from the technical perspective.  I think you need to make a choice here, because this gives the impression 
that you don’t know what you want. An alternative, which seems more logical to me, is: we want to work on this and this technique to 
find … which works for a range of applications…. And as a concrete case we work on sleep apnea
 
As a remark: you are using the abbreviation OSA, but do not introduce it

Pietro: 
I agree with Joel’s feedback. The structure he proposes is clearer, more focused on the technique, and not too much application dependent. 
This is also relevant because from your description it is unclear whether the accuracy of current algorithms for detecting OSA is still 
sub-optimal or not, which could make someone wonder what is the benefit to go for novel approaches.
 
Moreover, please make sure to add references to the figures, in case you did not generate those yourselves, but you took it from other sources.
 
Best,
Pietro
