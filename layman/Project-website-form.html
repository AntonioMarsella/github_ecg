<h4>Problem statement and motivation:</h4>
<p align="justify">
There are several diseases and disorders which can be detected by monitoring ECG recordings. Usually these diagnoses require a long process, 
several tools and expertise and are therefore very time consuming and expensive. In the case of Sleep Apnea for instance researchers have 
developed detection techniques using less information, such as from single-lead ECG recordings. From these recordings, often time, 
time-frequency and frequency features are computed and subsequently used for machine learning algorithms. Examples are Support Vector 
Machines (SVM) (Khandoker et al., 2009), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) (Cheng et al., 2017) and Hidden Markov Models and Deep 
Learning (Li et al., 2018).

<p align="justify">
While the accuracy is steadily improving over the years, it would be of much more use if it were possible to develop a technique that 
could be applied to other medical problems that be detected by changes in the ECG over time. Only one example is ischemia where the 
current diagnosis is based on a potentially harmful treadmill test which would not be necessary any more.</p>
<p align="justify">
We want to compare different representations of the data to find out which are suited better than others for classification and which 
features are the most important for those. Another aim is to find out whether Transfer Learning from a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
can be used for this task and if furthermore combining CNNs with RNNs can improve the accuracy taking into account timing (see fig. 2).</p>
<p align="justify">
However in our research we want to focus on the case of Sleep Apnea to be able to compare the results to previous research. 
Sleep Apnea is a common organic sleep disorder which is estimated to affect about 100 million people world-wide (Franklin et al., 2015). 
It creates frequent pauses of breathing during sleep which causes the brain to wake up every time to start breathing again and 
therefore leads to improper sleep. People suffering from this disease can experience drowsiness during the day or even more serious health 
risks such as cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases, as it is a cause of medical morbidity and mortality.

<h4>Research questions:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Can CNNs classify <i>one minute</i> signals to apnea vs non-apnea events?</li>
<li>Can transfer learning be used based on the CNNs pre-trained on ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) instead of training a whole CNN from scratch?</li>
<li>Can combining CNNs with RNNs improve accuracy taking into account timing?</li>
<li>What signal representation is better suited for the classification?
	<ul>
		<li>Signal in time or time-frequency domain?</li>
		<li>What are the most relevant features for such classification in different representations?</li>
	</ul>
